# React Click Game

## Project 
This project is still in development. Using the React web app I hope to have a functioning memory click game that utilizes jsx and ecma 6. This project so far has been tedious and time consuming but in a good way. I've learned more about how javascript works conceptually although given the time constraints it wasn't enough to complete the project. But what needs to be done for it to be complteted is the rest of the game logic which will shuffle the cards after each click, Based on my understanding componentDidMount needs to be utlized. Some psuedocode exists to show how i might go about writing the app based of another game i previously wrote.

### Remaining Tasks

1. Each image should listen for click events.
2. The application needs to keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order. The code written is inneficient in my opinion and can be written betterly so this is a project goal.
4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
